CEO&Co-founder Ulrich Kratz said: “During the last few years, thousands of great e-commerce                             businesses have grown rapidly on and off Amazon. Consumer demand for smaller and authentic brands                             is exploding. However, successful founders often find themselves overwhelmed by the complexities that                             come with sustainably operating and scaling an online brand. Despite quickly achieving $1 million or more                             in revenues and demonstrated profitability, these businesses still have very few avenues for business                             exits at a fair valuation.”", "    Kratz continued: “That’s where unybrands comes in: by quickly and reliably acquiring and integrating                             high-performing businesses into our shared set of expert resources and infrastructure, we give these                             companies the opportunity to enjoy consistent high growth and long-term success.
